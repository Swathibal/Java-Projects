The Employee table holds all employees including their managers. Every employee has an Id, and there is also a column for the manager Id.

Table : Employee
- Id
- Name
- Salary
- ManagerId

Given the Employee table, write a SQL query that finds out employees who earn more than their managers. For the above table, Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```
Select a.Name as Employee from Employee a,Employee b where a.ManagerId is Not NULL and a.ManagerId = b.Id and a.Salary > b.Salary;
```
