Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers
- Id
- Name

Table: Orders
- Id
- CustomerId
```
Select Name as Customers from Customers where Id not in (Select CustomerId from Orders);
```
